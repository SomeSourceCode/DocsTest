title: Panes
description: Panes provide a way to organize the visual structure of your GUI.
---

## Purpose

Panes are a fundamental part of the layout system in SomeGuiApi. They allow you to create complex and organized GUIs. Their main purpose is to lay out their children
and to provide background, etc.

## Adding Children

Every `Pane` provides a `getChildren()` method to access its children. You can add `Nodes` to the pane like this:

```java
Pane pane = new Pane();
pane.getChildren().add(...);
```

You can also add multiple children at once:

```java
pane.getChildren().addAll(...);
```

Adding children to a pane will automatically request a layout update, meaning that in the next render pass (e.g. triggered by the `update()` or `show()` method), the pane will lay out its children accordingly.

<Info>
	`Panes` are `Nodes` themselves, so you can add them to other panes as well. This allows for nested layouts, where a pane can contain other panes, creating a hierarchy of layout containers.
</Info>

## Layout Strategies

The `Pane` used till now is the basis for all kinds of panes with different layout mechanisms. The _"normal"_ `Pane` does not have a layout strategy at all.
It just keeps the children's coordinates as they are.

There are other strategies that you can explore on the following pages.

## Shared Pane Properties

All panes share some common properties defined by the basic `Pane`:

### Background

You can set a background for a pane using the `setBackground()` method. There are several different types of backgrounds that you create with the static methods of the `Background` class.
A background expects `Pixels` as the item information, which are a wrapper around `ItemStack`.

The simplest kind of background is a static background:

```java
pane.setBackground(Background.fill(
	Pixel.blank(Material.GRAY_STAINED_GLASS_PANE)
));
```

Another provided background is the `checkerboard()`, which - like the name suggests - creates a checkerboard pattern:

```java
pane.setBackground(Background.checkerboard(
	Pixel.blank(Material.GRAY_STAINED_GLASS_PANE),
	Pixel.blank(Material.WHITE_STAINED_GLASS_PANE)
));
```

You can also create custom background patterns via a lambda: A background is essentially a function that accepts an `x` and `y` coordinate and returns a `Pixel`:

```java
pane.setBackground((int x, int y) -> {
	// Implement your custom background logic here
	return ...;
});
```

<Note>
	The provided coordinates are relative to the pane, meaning that `(0, 0)` refers to the top-left corner of the pane itself, not the entire GUI.
</Note>

### Padding

<Frame rounded={false} overflowBottom>
	![Padding of 1 on each side](/images/layout-padding.png)
</Frame>

Padding is the space between the pane's border and its children. Every `Pane` provides a `setPadding()` method that accepts an object of type
`Insets`. This allows you to specify the padding for each side of the pane (top, right, bottom, left).

```java
pane.setPadding(new Insets(1, 2, 3, 4));
```

The padding must be applied in the layout calculations by the `Pane` itself. Since the plain `Pane` does not have a layout strategy, it does not apply padding by default.
All other provided panes will apply the padding automatically.

### Clipping

Clipping restricts the visible area of a pane to its bounds. This means that any content outside the bounds of the pane will not be rendered.
For example, if a child extends beyond the edges of the pane or is placed outside the pane's bounds, it will not be visible.

You can control the clipping behavior using the `setClipping()` method:

```java
pane.setClipping(false);
```

<Info>
	Clipping is enabled by default.
