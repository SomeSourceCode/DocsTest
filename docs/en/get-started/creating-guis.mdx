## Create Your First GUI

Creating a simple GUI is straightforward:

```java
ChestGui gui = new ChestGui("My First GUI", 3);
```

The first argument is the title. It can be a `String` or a `Component`.
Following the title is an optional number of rows, which can range
from `1` to `6`. If no number is provided, `6` is assumed.\
\
Now show your GUI to a player:

```java
gui.show(player);
```

## Closing a GUI

To close a GUI, you can use the `close()` method that takes an optional `viewer` parameter.

```java
gui.close(player);
```

If the provided entity is not a viewer of the GUI, it will be ignored.

<Info>
	The `close()` method will also close the GUI for all viewers if no entity is provided.
