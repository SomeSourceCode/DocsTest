## Types of States

There are many different types of states, like the basic `ObjectState<T>` as well as other useful ones,
including `StringState`, `IntegerState`, `BooleanState`, etc.

<Note>
In theory, `ObjectState<T>` could be used for any state, but the others provide additional type specific functionality,
especially when it comes to state interaction and validation.

This is a full list of every available state:

<Info>
Generally, there's the `ObjectState`, `StringState` and a `State` for every primitive data type.

- `ObjectState`
- `StringState`
- `IntegerState`
- `DoubleState`
- `FloatState`
- `BooleanState`
- `ByteState`
- `ShortState`

## Constructing States

To create a state, the easiest method is to use a constructor. Every `State` has a "simple" implementation.
It can be initialized like this:

```java
IntegerState intState = new SimpleIntegerState();
```

An optional default initial value can be passed:

```java
IntegerState intState = new SimpleIntegerState(42);
```

## Managing State Values

You can access or update the value of a state using the `get` and `set` methods:

```java
DoubleState doubleState = new DoubleState(3.141);
double pi = doubleState.get(); // returns 3.141

doubleState.set(2.718);
double e = doubleState.get(); // returns 2.718
```
