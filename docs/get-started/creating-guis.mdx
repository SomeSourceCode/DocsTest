## Create Your First GUI

Creating a simple GUI is straightforward:

```java
ChestGui gui = new ChestGui("My First GUI", 3);
```

The first argument is the title. It can be a `String` or a `Component`.
Following the title is an optional number of rows, which can range
from `1` to `6`. If no number is provided, `6` is assumed.\
\
Now show your GUI to a player:

```java
gui.show(player);
```
