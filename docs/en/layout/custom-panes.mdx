If you feel like the default panes provided by SomeGuiApi don't fit your needs, you can create your own custom panes. This page will provide you with steps
to create custom panes that can be used in your GUI layouts.

<Note>
	This way of creating custom panes is just a suggestion that follows the same pattern as used by the default panes.

## Extending the `Pane` class

Typically, when creating a pane, you wanna extend the `Pane` class, because it is this one that exposes the `getChildren()` method which allows for
adding child nodes to the pane:

```java title="MyCustomPane.java" showLineNumbers
import io.github.somesourcecode.someguiapi.scene.layout.Pane;

public class MyCustomPane extends Pane {

	public MyCustomPane() {
		super();
	}

}
```

Make sure to call the constructor of the superclass, so that the pane is properly initialized.

## Implementing the layout strategy

Currently, your pane acts the same as the normal `Pane`: It leaves every `Node` at it's specified coordinates. To override that default behavior,
you need to implement the `layoutChildren()` method. This method is called whenever the pane needs to update its layout, for example when a child node is added or removed.

```java title="MyCustomPane.java" showLineNumbers
import io.github.somesourcecode.someguiapi.scene.layout.Pane;

public class MyCustomPane extends Pane {

	public MyCustomPane() {
		super();
	}

	// highlight-start
	@Override
	public void layoutChildren() {
		for (Node child : getChildren()) {
			// Set the position of the child node based on your custom logic
			// For example, you could center all children in the pane:
			int x = (getWidth() - child.getWidth()) / 2;
			int y = (getHeight() - child.getHeight()) / 2;
			child.relocate(x, y);
		}
	}
	// highlight-end

}
```

## Custom Pane Properties

- add properties...
- call `requestLayout()` / `requestParentLayout()`
