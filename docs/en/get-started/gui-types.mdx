## Understanding GUI Types

GUIs are split into two main categories, scene-based and static.

<Note>
	The `Merchant GUI` is an exception and doesn't fit in those categories.
</Note>

### Scene GUIs

Most GUIs are scene-based, featuring a grid of item slots. We call this grid a Scene,
which holds the content of the GUI.

<Accordion title="Populating A Scene GUI">
	Alright, let's break this down with an example using a `ChestGui`. Here's how you get started:

	1. **Create a new instance of `ChestGui`:**\
		Just like you did before!

		```java
		ChestGui gui = new ChestGui("Title", 3);
		```

	2. **Set up the content inside a root node:**\
		The content will be living inside a root node of type `Parent`. This can be a `Pane`, for example.

		```java
		Pane root = new Pane();
		root.resize(9, 3);
		root.getChildren().add(/* Content goes here */);
		```

		<Warning>
			Remember to resize the root! Otherwise, it won't be visible.
		</Warning>

	3. **Create a `Scene`**\
		Wrap the root inside a `Scene` and pass it to the GUI:

		```java
		Scene scene = new Scene(root);
		gui.setScene(scene);
		```

	And just like that, you've populated a scene-based GUI!
</Accordion>

<Info>
	Typical scene-based GUIs are those with type of `Chest`, `Dropper`, `Hopper`, ...
</Info>

### Static GUIs

GUIs containing only single item slots are static GUIs. They don't contain a scene,
instead you populate each slot individually.

	I actually haven't implemented that functionality yet...
</Accordion>

<Info>
	Examples include GUIs of type `Anvil`, `Beacon`, `Brewing Stand`, `Furnace`, ...
</Info>

### Hybrids

Hybrid GUIs combine both concepts. It is those GUIs that contain a
grid as well as singular item slots.

<Info>
	An example for such a hybrid GUI is the `WorkbenchGUI`.
