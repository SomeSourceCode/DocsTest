title: Parent GUIs
description: Simplify GUI navigation with parent GUIs.
---

Not only nodes can have parents, but entire GUIs can as well. Though they work a little differently.

## Purpose

Parent GUIs make it easy to navigate between different GUIs. When a GUI is closed, it will automatically return to its parent, if one is set.
This is particularly useful for GUIs that are part of a larger navigation structure, such as menus or sub-menus.

## Setting a Parent GUI

To set a parent GUI, you can use the `setParent()` method on a GUI:

```java
subGui.setParent(mainGui);
```

This will set `mainGui` as the parent of `subGui`. When `subGui` is closed, it will automatically return to `mainGui`.\
\
A GUI can only have one parent at a time. If you set a new parent, the old one will be replaced.
The relationship between parent and child GUIs is one-way, meaning that a parent GUI does not know about its children.

## Navigation with Parent GUIs

SomeGuiApi provides some convenience methods to navigate between GUIs. To navigate to the parent manually, just do:

```java
subGui.navigateToParent(viewer);
```

This will return to the parent, if one is set. Otherwise, this method does nothing. If you want to default to closing instead, use:

```java
subGui.navigateToParentOrClose(viewer);
```

There's also a way to navigate to a child GUI, meaning to open a new GUI and set the current one as its parent:

```java
mainGui.navigateTo(subGui, viewer);
```
