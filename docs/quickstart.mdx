## Adding The Dependency

<Tab tabTitle="Maven" tabId="maven">
If you're using Maven, just add the following dependency to your `dependencies` section
of your `pom.xml` file.

```xml title="pom.xml"
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.somesourcecode</groupId>
    <artifactId>someguiapi</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```
</Tab>

<Tab tabTitle="Gradle" tabId="gradle">
For Gradle you need to include the repository and dependency as shown here:

```gradle title="gradle.build.kt"
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url = uri('https://repo.somesourcecode.io/repository/maven-public/') }
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly 'io.github.somesourcecode:someguiapi:2.1.0'
}
```
