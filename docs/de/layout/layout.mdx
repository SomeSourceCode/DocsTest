    Das Layout-System in SomeGuiApi zu verstehen, ist entscheidend für die Erstellung effektiver GUIs.
    Dieser Guide hilft dir, die Grundlagen des Layout-Systems zu verstehen, einschließlich des Koordinatensystems, der Hierarchie und der Layout-Eigenschaften.

## Layout System

Like most GUI systems, SomeGuiApi uses the typical computer coordinate system, where the origin `(0, 0)` is at the top-left corner of the screen. The x-axis extends to the right, and the y-axis extends downwards.
This means that as you move right, the x-coordinate increases, and as you move down, the y-coordinate increases.\
The dimensions align with the slots of Minecraft's inventories.

</Frame>

Following that logic, the marked area has the following properties:
- Coordinates: `(2, 1)`
- Size: `4x3` (width x height)

## Hierarchy

The layout of a GUI is determined by the layout tree structure, which consists of `Nodes` that can be parents or leaf nodes.
Each node can have multiple children, but only one parent. `Parents` are usually a type of [`Pane`](/panes), the ultimate leaf nodes will be `GuiItems`.

`Nodes` can be arbitrarily nested, allowing for complex layouts. Note that a node can only be the child of at most one other node.
The coordinates of a `Node` are always relative to its direct `Parent`. Suppose you add a `GuiItem` at `(1, 1)` inside the above mentioned region, this is
where it will be placed:

</Frame>

The root of the layout tree is contained in a `Scene`, which is the top-level container for all GUI elements.

## Layout Properties

Every `Node` has a few basic layout properties:

### `layoutX` and `layoutY`

...

### `translateX` and `translateY`

...

\
`Regions` are a type of `Node` with additional properties that control their size and clipping:

### `width` and `height`

...

### Clipping

...
