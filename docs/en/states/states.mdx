title: States
description: Make use of observable states to create dynamic and interactive GUIs!
---

Most properties in SomeGuiApi are not only accessible via getters and setters.
Instead, they are observable states, providing a way to listen for changes or to interlink them with other states.

## Types of States

There are several types of states in SomeGuiApi: A generic `ObjectState<T>` for any type and one for each common
primitive type: `BooleanState`, `IntegerState`, `LongState`, `FloatState` and `DoubleState`.

<Info>
	Although `String` is not a primitive type in Java, there is also a `StringState` available.

## Accessing States

If a property is available as a state, it can be accessed via a getter that is named after the property, followed by `State`.
For example, to access the `layoutX` state on a `Node`, you can use the `layoutXState()` method:

```java
Node node = ...;
IntegerState layoutXState = node.layoutXState();
```

## Setting and Getting Values

To get the value of a state, you can use the `get()` method:

```java
int layoutX = layoutXState.get();
```

To set a new value, you can use the `set()` method:

```java
layoutXState.set(5);
```

Note that some states are read-only and do not provide a `set()` method, such as the `xState` or `yState` on a `Node`.

## Observers

A key feature of states is the ability to observe changes. An `Observer` is added to a state via the `observe()` method. You can provide it with
a lambda expression that takes the old and new value as parameters:

```java
layoutXState.observe((oldValue, newValue) -> {
	System.out.println("Layout X changed from " + oldValue + " to " + newValue);
});
```

It is guaranteed that `oldValue != newValue` will be true.\
\
To remove an observer, you can use the `removeObserver()` method:

```java
layoutXState.removeObserver(observer);
```

There's also a shorthand that takes a `Runnable` for adding an observer that doesn't require the old or new value. Since you need the `Observer`
instance to remove it later, that shorthand returns the `Observer` instance:

```java
Observer observer = layoutXState.observe(() -> {
	System.out.println("Layout X changed");
});
layoutXState.removeObserver(observer);
```
