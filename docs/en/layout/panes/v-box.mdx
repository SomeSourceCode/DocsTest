## Layout

The `VBox` is a type of `Pane` that arranges its children in a single vertical column without wrapping.

</Frame>

## Properties

Apart from the [common properties](layout/panes#shared-pane-properties) that all panes have, the `VBox` has the following specific properties:

### `spacing`

The `spacing` property defines the space between each child in the `VBox`. It is set using the `setSpacing(int spacing)` method.

```java
vbox.setSpacing(1);
```

This would produce a layout where each child has a space of 1 slot between them:
