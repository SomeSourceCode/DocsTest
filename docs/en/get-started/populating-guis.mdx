## Scene GUIs

`ChestGui` ist currently the only type of GUI. It is a scene-based GUI, which means it uses a `Scene` to hold its content.

<Info>
	Other types of GUIs will be added in the future, such as `AnvilGui`, `BeaconGui`, etc.

### Populating A Scene GUI

Alright, let's break this down with an example using a `ChestGui`. Here's how you get started:

1. **Create a new instance of `ChestGui`:**\
	Just like you did before!

	```java
	ChestGui gui = new ChestGui("Title", 3);
	```

2. **Set up the content inside a root node:**\
	The content will be living inside a root node of type `Parent`. This can be a `Pane`, for example.

	```java
	Pane root = new Pane();
	root.resize(9, 3);
	root.getChildren().add(/* Content goes here */);
	```

	<Warning>
		Remember to resize the root! Otherwise, it won't be visible.
	</Warning>

3. **Create a `Scene`**\
	Wrap the root inside a `Scene` and pass it to the GUI:

	```java
	Scene scene = new Scene(root);
	gui.setScene(scene);
	```

And just like that, you've populated a scene-based GUI!
